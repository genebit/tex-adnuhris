\chapter{Interview Transcript}

To further understand the processes of the current HRIS along with specific details, the researchers sent a formal interview request letter on July 1, 2024. The document has undergo-ed reviews, approval, and endorsement of the SP Adviser/Dean/CITO/CSIO, as well as the CCS Chairperson, and given that the project is an MIS initiative, the approval of the MIS Director is requested.

On July 5, 2024, the researchers conducted a formal interview along with the System Administrator Specialist, HRMO -- Ms. Leanne Gemelly B. Briones. The interview lasted from 3:00PM to 4:00PM.

The interview covered various aspects of the current HRMO system and processes, starting from a general overview regarding HRIS to user experience, system limitations, data management, current requirements, and diagrams and documents. This allowed the researchers to better gain understanding of the processes and identify priorities within modules to create and disregard.

%   \gene Perhaps something that aligns the names to the text, and uses a columnar layout for the people vs what they said.
