The team extends their sincerest gratitude to all of those who have contributed to the completion of this capstone project.

We would like to give our thanks and gratitude to our adviser, Mr. Joshua C. Martinez, MIT, for his  guidance and support towards the project and throughout the duration of this study. 

We would like to also give our thanks to Ms. Estrella H. Montealegre, Management Information System (MIS) Director, for her  guidance, acknowledgment, and support for the approval of the project to become an MIS migration initiative. Without her approval, this project would not have been possible in the first place. 

We are also grateful to the faculty members of the Department of Computer Science for their assistance, comments/suggestions, and advice to the team.

Finally, we extend our gratitude to the staff and administrators of Ateneo de Naga University's Human Resource employees for their cooperation and assistance in providing access to resources and information necessary for this study. Their assistance made this project more concrete and achievable.
