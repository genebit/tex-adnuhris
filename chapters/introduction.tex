Human Resource Management (HRM) plays an important role in the success and efficiency of institutions. HRM is responsible for managing the most valuable asset of any organizationâ€”its people. The primary functions of HRM include recruitment, training, development, performance management, and employee relations. These functions are essential for building a productive and thriving workforce, which is crucial for achieving organizational goals and maintaining a competitive edge in the market \cite{a12019,t12020}.

HR professionals act as strategic partners to the management team, advising on managing human resources effectively to meet the institution's current and future needs. They are involved in developing strategies for talent acquisition, employee retention, and skill development, ensuring the workforce is aligned with the organization's objectives. Additionally, HRM plays a significant role in fostering a positive work environment, enhancing employee engagement, and building loyalty and commitment among employees \cite{b12021,d12022}.

A Human Resources Information System (HRIS) is a software solution designed to manage and automate core HR processes. HRIS serves as a centralized repository for employee data, facilitating efficient data management, payroll processing, benefits administration, time and attendance tracking, and performance management \cite{m22024,o12023}. The implementation of an HRIS transforms HR from an administrative function to a strategic one, enabling HR professionals to focus on more value-added activities such as strategic planning and decision-making \cite{n12023}.

By automating routine HR tasks, HRIS reduces the administrative burden on HR professionals, allowing them to allocate more time to strategic initiatives. This automation leads to increased efficiency, accuracy, and compliance with labor laws and regulations. Moreover, HRIS provides real-time data access and advanced analytics capabilities, which are essential for informed decision-making and strategic workforce planning \cite{gym12024,h12022}.

HRIS also enhances the employee experience by offering self-service portals where employees can access and update their personal information, request time off, and manage their benefits. This not only improves employee satisfaction but also reduces the workload on HR staff. Furthermore, the integration of HRIS with other business systems ensures seamless data flow and consistency across the organization, contributing to overall operational efficiency \cite{a22023,s12022}.

\section{Project Context}
    
    The Human Resource and Management Office (HRMO) at Ateneo de Naga University has been utilizing a system that has served the institution well over the years. This system, consisting of disparate databases and applications, has been instrumental in managing HR processes and maintaining employee records.
