\section{Development Model}
In the development process of the system, the developers will utilize the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model as a project management strategy. This methodology is characterized by an iterative approach in the software development process, which begins with the specification of requirements from the users and proceeds through rapid prototyping iterative delivery, and continual maintenance for the currently completed software. This methodology is well-suited for the study as it provides researchers a clear overview to follow from the beginning to the end, making it easier to track each step's progress as well as make sure everything went according to the plan. Moreover, the RAD model is perfect to use for projects with expedited schedules and evolving requirements as it lays a strong emphasis on speed, adaptability, and user-centric design. 

The implementation of RAD provides a substantial advantage in developing the HRIS application. In terms of speed in development, RAD makes it possible to develop and release new features, which makes it ideal for projects with tight deadlines. And because of its adaptability, it can accommodate changes in requirements even at the end of the development cycle, guaranteeing that the result fulfills the requirements of the users. With the user-centric nature of RAD, it includes user feedback in every iteration, which could increase user satisfaction with the finished product. Furthermore, this methodology includes a risk reduction aspect which implies that early prototypes can help in recognizing any potential issues and reducing risks associated with functionality and usability. Due to RAD's iteration methodology, the HRIS system may be continuously improved in response to user feedback and changing educational requirements, keeping it updated and efficient in providing the desired outcomes.

\section{System Analysis}
The system analysis phase of the HRIS application development involves utilizing various methods to understand and define the system's functional and data requirements. These include information gathering, analytical methods, personnel consultation assessments, and content analysis. These methods aid in identifying user needs, defining system functionalities, and establishing the database schema. 

Through the use of visual tools like Swim-lane Diagram, Use case Diagrams, Entity Relational Diagrams, and Gantt charts, the system analysis phase enables a comprehensive understanding of the HRIS application's scope and requirements. By employing a systematic approach to system analysis, the development team can ensure that the HRIS application is designed and implemented in alignment with the project objectives and user expectations.

    \subsection{Swim-lane Diagram}
    The Swim-lane diagram illustrates the process flow of the HRIS. The process begins when the user enters their login credentials. These credentials are unique to each University faculty employee, distinguishing them from other users in the system. Each user has different privileges and assignments set initially to access the system. After entering the credentials, the system validates them, granting the user access to the system. Once the user successfully logs in, they are directed to the dashboard where they can perform different actions depending on their privileges e.g., perform employee actions or tasks and HR overall general management.

    The identified roles i.e., Director, Sys. Admin, Attendance Monitoring and Checker, Training \& Dev. Specialist, Records Mgt. Specialist, Comp. \& Benefits Officer, ISS Officer, Recruitment \& Admin Staff, and Capability Bldg. Officer, are assigned specific tasks and responsibilities within the system. These responsibilities and privileges are outlined in table \ref*{tab:hris-basic-modules}. 

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/images/swimlane-admins.png}
        \caption{HRIS Swim-lane Diagram Model for HR Management.}
        \label{fig:swimlane-admins}
    \end{figure}

    Each role area can perform admin privileges and manage different modules within the system. For these actions, they are processed and managed under the system to provide a streamlined operation for any users in the system. Higher admins will have access to core modules e.g., Manage employee/personnel containing the employee contacts, personal information, profiles, assignments, assignment archive, faculty rank, academic, academic awards, professional license, training attendance, Certificate of Employment (COE), and health record.

    Besides this, these admins can also generate different kinds of reports within the system e.g., performing data extraction, queries, employee performance evaluation, COE reports, contracts/appointment generation, etc.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/images/swimlane-sys-mgt.png}
        \caption{HRIS Swim-lane Diagram Model for TIMESYS, FACSYS, and LEAVESYS Management.}
        \label{fig:swimlane-sys-mgt}
    \end{figure}

    The system also includes modules for TIMESYS, FACSYS, and LEAVESYS. These modules are designed to manage employee attendance, faculty attendance, and employee leave applications, respectively. In the diagram, the identified roles along with their privilege are assigned to manage the three (3) SYS as well as allowing them to generate reports. Meanwhile, the Student Assistant Attendance Checker has lesser privilege and is assigned only to managing faculty attendance, faculty schedule, and managing pending faculty schedules.

    \subsection{Use Case Diagram}
    
    The use case diagram serves as a visual representation of the functional requirements of the system from an external user's perspective. It illustrates the interactions between users and the system, showcasing the various use cases and how they relate to each other. Each module referred to in \ref*{tab:hris-basic-modules}, \ref*{tab:hris-facsys-modules}, \ref*{tab:hris-leavesys-modules}, \ref*{tab:hris-timesys-modules} has specific use cases that define the functionalities and interactions within the system. Moreover, each module has different actors with specific roles and access levels, allowing for a comprehensive overview of the system's behavior and user interactions.
    
    Additionally, the concept of 'Manage' refers to the access users have to create, view, edit, and archive data or information within specific modules, By mapping out these interactions and incorporating both 'Manage' and 'View' functionalities, the use case diagram helps in identifying the system's behavior and the roles of different users in the HRIS application.

    In the HRIS Basic Modules Use Case Diagram, alongside Performing Data Extraction and Managing/Viewing Performance Evaluation, the use cases are grouped into four primary functional areas: Employee Information Access, Employment and Assignment Access, Academic and Professional Development Access, and Certification and Reporting Access. Each area extends to specific management or viewing capabilities. Employee Information Access covers personal data, profiles, health records, and professional licenses. Employment and Assignment Access encompasses employee assignments, their archives, and status information. Academic and Professional Development Access includes academic records, awards, and attended training sessions. Lastly, Certification and Reporting Access handles COE (Certificate of Employment) requests, reports, and contracts/appointments generation. This structure allows for efficient organization of various HRIS functions, providing comprehensive coverage of employee-related data management and access across different aspects of human resource operations.
